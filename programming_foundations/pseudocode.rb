# For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does
# the following:

# a method that returns the sum of two integers

=begin
START
  GET number1
    SET number1
  GET number2
    SET number2
  PRINT sum of number1 and number2
END
=end

# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all
# those strings concatenated together

=begin
START
  GET string
    SET string to an array
  PRINT the array joined together
END
=end

# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with
# every other element

=begin
START
  GET array of integers
    SET array of integers
  SET every other array variable to nil
  IF index % 2 == 0
    every other array variable << value
  ELSE
    next
  END
  PRINT the every other array
END
=end
